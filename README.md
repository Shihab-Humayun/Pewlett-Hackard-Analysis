# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to create queries from provided databases to Bobby's manager. The queries are to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. We used DISTINCT ON, COUNT(), and other statements to create these queries.

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables.
